                    <h3 class="denial">Denial</h3>
                    <p>
                        Denial is perhaps one of the most common defense mechanisms witnessed as a response to a difficult reality. One may invariably hear that a person is 'in denial' of a fact. This simply means that the person is employing this particular defense mechanism, denial, in refusing to accept an unpleasant truth. For example, if accused of being addicted to cigarettes, a person may reply, 'I can quit any time I choose.' However, this is not the case.

                    <h3 class="denial">Repression</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Repression is a mechanism used in blocking from consciousness the disturbing or traumatic thoughts of an experience. A woman who was raped may suppress the memory of the event because it is too difficult to consciously contemplate on a regular basis. It is therefore repressed from conscious cognition. She is therefore spared the constant pain of an agonizing recollection.

                    <h3 class="denial">Projection</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Projection occurs when a person attributes, or projects, their own maladaptive or negative impulses onto another person. For example, a person may accuse a romantic partner of being jealous or insecure in the relationship when, in fact, the accuser is guilty of these very things.

                        Psychoanalysis (from Greek: ψυχή, psykhḗ, 'soul' + ἀνάλυσις, análysis, 'investigate') is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques that deal in part with the unconscious mind, and which together form a method of treatment for mental disorders. The discipline was established in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud, who developed the practice from his theoretical model of personality organization and development, psychoanalytic theory. Freud's work stems partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others. Psychoanalysis was later developed in different directions, mostly by students of Freud, such as Alfred Adler and his collaborator, Carl Gustav Jung, as well as by neo-Freudian thinkers, such as Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.

                    <p>
                        Psychoanalysis is a controversial discipline, and its effectiveness as a treatment has been contested. It has been largely replaced by the similar but broader psychodynamic psychotherapy in the mid-20th century, although it retains a salient influence within psychiatry. Psychoanalytic concepts are also widely used outside the therapeutic arena, in areas such as psychoanalytic literary criticism, as well as in the analysis of film, fairy tales, philosophical perspectives as Freudo-Marxism and other cultural phenomena.
